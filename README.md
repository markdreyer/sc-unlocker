# MEX Unlocker

Contract to swap `LKMEX` into `MEX` tokens for a fee. You should be holding your `LKMEX`, but if circumstances change, you can swap it out for `MEX` here.

## Tokenomics

`LKMEX` was designed to enable long-term holding and reduce `MEX` sell pressure on the Maiar DEX. While `LKMEX` can be used for providing liquidity, it cannot be swapped for other assets on the DEX. This is great for the exchange, however individuals may find themselves in a situation where they need to swap `LKMEX` for `MEX` to get liquidity.

Reasons why individuals may need to swap:

- DEX Strategy: You overestimated your LKMEX/MEX ratio in your strategy. Now you have too much `LKMEX` and you need to re-balance it to keep your strategy's ratio

- Cash Out: You had grand plans of holding, but now you want to buy a house or you had a baby and need those funds. It's like cashing out a CD early; you may take a hit on what you could earn long-term, but you'll have instant access to your money.

- Volatility: The short-term price is too volatile and you would like to swap into a more stable coin.

- Trading: You see short-term opportunities for trading and need liquidity now. 

### Isn't this bad for MEX token?

We are firm believers in both the short and long-term success of the Maiar DEX. We are in it for the long-haul and are willing to hold `LKMEX` for many years.

Any selling pressure on `MEX` created by this contract will be offset by us buying more `MEX` to provide liquidity to the contract.
